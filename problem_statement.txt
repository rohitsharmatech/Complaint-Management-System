Problem Statement

The objective of the project was discussed in the last page. The objective of this project is
based solely on a few issues that need to be addressed. Here, I’ll breakdown the reasons this
project was taken up. These are more or less based on the requirements of the company
NHPC and how this product can be of use in other platforms:
i. As the complaint management system already that has a lot of functionality
making it very useful for the users. The website page needs to be loaded first and
it’s a bit of work and time consuming. Hence, there is a need to come up with an
application that can make this process a little faster.
ii. Another reason why this project is important is to make a product that is not only
valuable to the NHPC company, but also can be used by other organizations at
this level having a lot of employees.
iii. The application should have fast backend coding to make it work fast and another
important aspect of this project is choosing the database software. For this project,
we are relying on Firebase Realtime NoSQL database. And the software used to
make this app is android studio, used for both designing and coding purposes.
iv. Keeping that in mind, the first thing that suggested was to build an app that can
systematically store complaints of the users and the supervisors of those
complaints can separately resolve them.
